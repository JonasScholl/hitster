## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
- Music service developer account (Spotify or Apple Music)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hitster.git
cd hitster

# Install Python dependencies
poetry install
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

### Spotify Setup

1. **Create Spotify App**
   - Visit [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
   - Create a new app and note your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`

2. **Configure Environment**
    - Copy the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`
    - Edit the file and provide these variables
        ```bash
        PROVIDER="spotify"
        CLIENT_ID="your_spotify_client_id"
        CLIENT_SECRET="your_spotify_client_secret"
        PLAYLIST_ID="your_playlist_id"
        ```

> *Disclaimer*: Spotify has deprecated preview URLs from their API and most songs don't have any preview URL. Currently the only reliable option is to just play the whole song from the beginning instead of a cutout (not optimal for the game). This is configurable via the `SPOTIFY_USE_PREVIEW_URL` environment variable.

### Apple Music Setup

1. **Get Apple Developer Credentials**
   - Join [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) (active membership costs 99$ per year)
   - Create a MusicKit identifier and generate a private key with the MusicKit scope
   - Note your Team ID and Key ID

2. **Configure Environment**
   - Copy the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`
   - Edit the file and provide these variables
        ```bash
        PROVIDER="apple-music"
        APPLE_TEAM_ID="your_team_id"
        APPLE_KEY_ID="your_key_id"
        APPLE_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH="path/to/your/private_key.p8"
        PLAYLIST_ID="your_apple_music_playlist_id"

        # Optional: For private playlists
        APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN="your_user_token"
        ```

## üéØ Usage

### Generate Cards

```bash
poetry run python -m generator.main
```

If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can also run the `Generate Hitster Cards` launch config.

This creates:
- `generated/hitster.pdf` ‚Äî Printable cards
- `generated/overview.pdf` ‚Äî Year-based song overview

### QR Code Scanner

Visit **[hitster.scholl.tech](https://hitster.scholl.tech)** to scan your generated QR codes and play audio previews directly in your browser.

### Printing

1. Open `generated/hitster.pdf`
2. Print duplex (double-sided) on cardstock
3. Cut along the provided marks
4. Start playing!

## üé≤ How to Play

1. **Scan** the QR code with your phone camera
2. **Listen** to the audio preview that plays
3. **Guess** the release year of the song
4. **Place** the card in chronological order on your timeline
5. **Win** by correctly placing the most cards!

These are the basic rules, for more information see the [official rules](https://hitstergame.com/en-gb/how-to-play-free/).

## üí° Recommendation

To make the game enjoyable it makes sense to have a large range of years with evenly distributed songs. Since the main goal is to classify the songs by year, it makes the game harder the closer the release years are.

An overview diagram of the release year distribution is automatically created as `generated/overview.pdf` file.
